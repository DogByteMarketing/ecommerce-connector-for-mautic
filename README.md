## Requirements

- Mautic 7.0+
- PHP 8.2+

## Installation

### 1. Take a backup

### 2. Add the plugin files

Copy the `EcommerceConnectorBundle` folder into your Mautic `plugins/` directory.

### 3. Install or upgrade the plugin (Settings → Plugins)

1. Log in to Mautic as an administrator.
2. Open **Settings** (gear icon) → **Plugins**.
3. Click **Install/Upgrade Plugins** in the top toolbar.
   - Mautic scans the `plugins/` directory and installs any new or updated plugins.
   - When upgrading from an older version, this also triggers database migrations automatically.

You should see **Ecommerce Connector** appear in the plugin grid after installation.

### 4. Configure the integration (three settings tabs)

Click the **Ecommerce Connector** plugin tile to open the integration settings modal. Configuration is split across three tabs.

#### Tab 1: Enabled/Auth

This tab controls whether the plugin is active and holds your webhook credentials.

1. Set **Active** to **Yes**.
   - Webhook requests are rejected while the integration is inactive.
2. Enter a **Webhook secret**.
   - Use a long, random string. Your store uses this to sign webhook requests.
   - This field is required for server-side order tracking.
3. Note the **Webhook URL** shown in the info box below the form.
   - Example: `https://your-mautic-site.com/mtc/ecommerce`
   - Use this URL in your eCommerce platform or custom integration.

Click **Save** or **Save & Close** before continuing, or configure the Features tab first and save once at the end.

#### Tab 2: Features

This tab controls how orders are validated and attributed.

| Setting | Recommended | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Track orders from page hits | Yes (for simple setups) | Record orders from thank-you page URL query parameters |
| Attribute revenue to last email sent | No | When no email is provided, link the order to the most recently sent email. Can misattribute revenue. |
| Allowed order sources | Leave blank | Comma-separated list (e.g. `web,woocommerce,shopify`). Blank allows any source. |
| Default currency | `USD` | Used when `order_currency` is not sent in the payload |
| Maximum order total | `1000000` | Orders above this amount are rejected |

Click **Save & Close** when finished.

#### Tab 3: Installation

Step-by-step setup instructions for connecting your store:

- **WordPress / WooCommerce:** use the [Sync Mautic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sync-mautic/) plugin with WP Mautic and this connector
- **Custom stores:** signed webhook integration guide with example PHP and cURL requests
- Contact information if you need a custom integration built for you

### 5. Connect your store

Configure your eCommerce platform to send signed `POST` requests to the webhook URL from step 3. See [Webhook tracking](#webhook-tracking) below for payload and signing details.

For a quick test without a store integration, enable **Track orders from page hits** and send visitors to a thank-you page with order query parameters. See [Page hit tracking](#page-hit-tracking).

## Upgrading

When deploying a new plugin version:

1. Replace the files in `plugins/EcommerceConnectorBundle/`.
2. Open **Settings → Plugins**.
3. Click **Install/Upgrade Plugins**.

Mautic compares the version in `Config/config.php` with the installed version and runs database migrations automatically when needed.

## Webhook tracking

Send a signed `POST` request to:

```
/mtc/ecommerce
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `order_id` | Yes | Unique order ID from your store |
| `order_total` | Yes | Order total (must be greater than zero) |
| `order_source` | No | Source identifier (default: `web`) |
| `order_currency` | No | 3-letter ISO 4217 code (default: configured default currency) |
| `email_id` | No | Mautic email ID to attribute revenue to |
| `ct` | No | Mautic clickthrough token for contact and email attribution |

### Signing requests

Sort parameters alphabetically, build a query string, then sign with HMAC SHA-256 using your webhook secret. Send the result in the `X-Mautic-Ecommerce-Signature` header.

```php
$params = [
    'order_id'       => '12345',
    'order_total'    => '99.99',
    'order_source'   => 'woocommerce',
    'order_currency' => 'USD',
];
ksort($params);
$signature = hash_hmac('sha256', http_build_query($params), 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET');
```

### Example (cURL)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-mautic-site.com/mtc/ecommerce" \
  -H "X-Mautic-Ecommerce-Signature: YOUR_SIGNATURE" \
  -d "order_id=12345" \
  -d "order_total=99.99" \
  -d "order_source=woocommerce" \
  -d "order_currency=USD"
```

## Page hit tracking

When **Track orders from page hits** is enabled, orders can also be recorded from landing page query parameters (for example on a thank-you page). Server-side webhooks are recommended for production stores.

Example thank-you page URL:

```
https://your-mautic-site.com/thank-you?order_id=12345&order_total=99.99&order_source=web
```

## Features

- Revenue badges on the email list and email detail views (currency symbols such as `$0.00`, grouped by currency when multiple currencies exist)
- Contact timeline entries for recorded orders
- Report builder data source: **Ecommerce orders**
- Duplicate order protection via unique constraint on `order_id` + `order_source`
- Contact profile commerce fields (lifetime value, order count, last order date, last order total)
- Segment filters for ecommerce activity and commerce field values
- Automatic database migrations on plugin update

## Development

Run plugin tests:

```bash
ddev exec php bin/phpunit -c app/phpunit.xml.dist plugins/EcommerceConnectorBundle/Tests
```
